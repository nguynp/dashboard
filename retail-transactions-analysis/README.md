A cohort is a collection of users who have something in common. A common traditional cohort would divide people by the week or month of their first acquisition or purchase (time cohort), making it customer-centric.
In this dashboard, the objective is to analyze newly acquired customers in 2010 and their performance in terms of retention (returning to purchase) and spending (revenue).

**Assumptions:**
* Customers who made their first purchase in 2010 are compared to the previous year (2009) due to the limitation of data (only 2009 to early 2011).
* Performance is tracked monthly -> monthly cohort - dividing all newly acquired customers in 2010 by month.

**Notable findings:**
* Customers acquired from August to October returned to purchase after 1 month the most, averaging above 30%.
* September to November had the highest customer return rates. Notably, in November, 39.39% of the September 2010 cohort and 36.67% of the July 2010 cohort made additional purchases.
* December had the fewest returning customers.
* March, September, October, and November attracted the most new customers, around 160-190, and generated top revenue in their first month, approximately $60k to $80k.
